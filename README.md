# HASS-assignment4

In this assignment, a choropleth map visualization of the 2020 population in Singapore subdistricts, separated by gender, was created using Leaflet and D3.
The data, specifically the Master Plan Subzone Boundary .kml file and the 2020 population .csv files, were taken from www.data.gov.sg, and cleaned before usage.
The .kml file had been converted to geojson format, and overlaid on the map from OneMap.SG.
Interactivity in this visualization includes a hover-tooltip that displays the Male/Female population of the subdistricts, as well as the buttons to display
the male and female maps and figures separately.
